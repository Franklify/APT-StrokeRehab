                    <p>Every year, almost 800,000 people suffer from strokes. Every time a person suffers from a stroke, he or she has a 20% chance of dying. Those who survive are often unable to continue their daily activities. Over 90% of survivors suffer from some degree of paralysis. <br>Intensive physical therapy gives stroke victims home of returning to their daily activities. Frequent exercises and appointments are key to victims' recovery. Paralysis victims often attend physical therapy once - or a few times - each week. Unfortunately, many survivors cannot afford frequent appointments, especially with physical limitations of their paralysis. <br>APT allows paralysis victims to receive immediate feedback about their recovery in the comfort of their home. By harnessing the power of the Myo Armband and the power of computation, APT shows paralysis victims what they are doing well, and where they have room to improve. Physical therapists and other health professionals can monitor and analyze their patients' recovery. </p> <br>
